# english_to_french

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that has a trained sequence-to-sequence network.
The network translates selected phrases from English to French.
It was trained on a corpus of 227 unique English words and serves as a proof-of-concept for sequence to sequence networks
rather than a full translator.
